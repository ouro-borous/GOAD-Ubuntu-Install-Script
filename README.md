# GOAD Ubuntu Install Script (working with 23.04)

- Please make sure you've got AT LEAST 24GB of RAM FREE AND AVAILABLE.
- Make sure you've got 120 GB of storage FREE AND AVAILABLE.
  - Make sure this space is ALL MOUNTED TO THE ROOT DIRECTORY. When creating this script, I was using VMWare and it had the memory split up, which GOAD didn't like.
